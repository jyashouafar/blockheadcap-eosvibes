## Blockhead Capital Proposed EOS Constitution

Blockhead Capital (www.blockheadcap.com) is a member of the EOSVibes block producer candidate (www.eosvibes.io). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the proposal set forth herein is the sole opinion of Blockhead Capital and does not intend to represent the views of anyone else, including any other members of the EOSVibes team.

As explained in our recent announcement regarding joining EOSVibes, we aim to take an active role in contributing to the development and governance of the EOS network - with an aim to make EOS as great as it can be. In that realm, we spent the past 2 months internally debating contributing a new proposed EOS constitution to the community and spent the past 3 weeks consulting trusted advisors and writing the below proposal. In the interim, EOS New York contributed what we view to be a highly well thought proposed "EOS Platform User Agreement" with a strategic change of nomenclature from the frequently used "Constitution."

We generally view our proposed document to be compatible with the EOS New York proposed Platform User Agreement and specifically view their proposed User Agreement to be "base layer" document which could underpin a more general document like the one we propose (and in fact, we reference their document in ours). Our document intends to act as a "bill of rights" which describes various user rights and responsibilities as well as certain fundamental characteristics of the EOS Network that should not be easily changed on a go-forward basis. Certain aspects were intentionally left vague (e.g., a potential EOS judiciary or arbitration committee) as we don't believe the specifics of a dispute resolution mechanism should be determined in one of these base documents (but rather layered somewhere above).

At this point we are turning over our work to the EOS community for insight/input/collaboration and are interested to see where and how it develops.
